# Introduction to VBBinaryLensing

VBBinaryLensing is a library for computations in microlensing.

A selection of recent reviews about microlensing and its applications can be found here.

VBBinaryLensing is designed for the following calculations:
- **Magnification** by single and binary lenses
- **Centroid** of the images generated by single and binary lenses
- **Critical curves and caustics** of binary lenses
- Complete **light curves and centroid trajectories** including several higher order effects: limb darkening of the source, binary source, parallax, xallarap, circular and elliptic orbital motion.

It is based on the contour integration principle upgraded with many advanced methods. 
- The basic algorithm is described in [MNRAS 408 (2010) 2188](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408.2188B/abstract).
- Further improvements with the introduction of the BinaryMag2 function (version 2.0) are described in [MNRAS 479 (2018) 5157](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.479.5157B/abstract).
- Astrometric calculations are described in [MNRAS 505 (2021) 126](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505..126B/abstract).

You are invited to cite the papers more relevant to your calculations if you use the code for scientific research.

VBBinaryLensing is also adopted by several user-friendly modeling platforms for microlensing:
- [pyLIMA](https://github.com/ebachelet/pyLIMA)
- [MulensModel](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel)
- [muLAn](https://github.com/muLAn-project/muLAn)

These platforms offer high-level functions for easy modeling of microlensing events. If you need direct access to bare API functions to include in your own project, this is the right place for you.
