# Light Curve Functions

VBBinaryLensing offers ready-to-use functions to calculate full microlensing light curves with standard parameters. There are functions for single and binary lenses, single and binary sources, for light curves including parallax, orbital motion or xallarap.

Each of these light curve functions accepts an array of parameters as first argument. The second argument is the time at which we want the magnification.
